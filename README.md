# Check-For-Best-Deals-At-AMZN
This script helps you to scrape the amazon web page of the product , check for the price ( i am doing for an echo plus device) and if the price falls down below your expectations , it send you an email for the same :) . Pretty handy right !

Packages required:

1) Beautiful soup
2) Smtplib
3) Requests 

Also make sure to setup Gmail 2 step verficiation and App passwords(in gmail, its under the security tag, and I am doing it for gmail too).
